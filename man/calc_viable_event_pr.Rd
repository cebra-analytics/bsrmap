\title{Calculate establishment viability event probabilities}
\usage{
calc_viable_event_pr(
  n_events,
  p_viable,
  confidence = 0.95,
  n_sims = 1e+05,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_events}{Numeric vector containing lower and upper bounds (CI) for
the number of leakage events.}

\item{p_viable}{Numeric vector containing the lower and upper bounds
(CI) for the probability a leakage event could result in an arrival with
establishment viability.}

\item{confidence}{Confidence interval (CI). Default = 0.95.}

\item{n_sims}{Integer. Number of samples to be taken from event and
establishment viability distributions. Default = 100000.}

\item{...}{Additional parameters (unused).}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} containing the possible number of incursions
that may occur, and their corresponding probabilities.
}
\description{
Calculate (via stochastic sampling) the probability of one or more
arrival events with establishment viability occurring as as a function of
estimated leakage numbers and the probability a leakage event could result
in an arrival with establishment viability.
